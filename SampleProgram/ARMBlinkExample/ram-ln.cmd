/*
   Linker options for loading a program in RAM on the AT91SAM7S256
   This goes with ram-crt.s
   by Adam Pierce http://www.doctort.org/adam

   I'm assuming here that the SAM-BA leaves the system in user mode with a
   stack and everything already configured.

   The AT91SAM7S256 has RAM starting from 0x00200000 to 0x0020FFFF. SAM-BA reserves
   some of that so we have a usable range of 0x00202000 to 0x0020FFFF.
